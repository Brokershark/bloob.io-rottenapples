## Can I share my own custom card sets?
Absolutely! You're highly encouraged to share your custom work. There are a few conditions you must meet and agree to for your submission to be added.

### Conditions
1. All custom card sets must follow the [Bloob.io](https://bloob.io/rottenapples) JSON format (the file you get when you download it from the site) to ensure compatibility.
2. While mixed cards may lead to (hilariously) inappropriate combinations, you may not submit cards containing slurs or racism.
3. All card sets posted here will be available to anyone who chooses to access it. If you did not make the card set, make sure to ask the creator for consent or have them share it instead.
4. Posting commercially available card sets is only permitted if their license explicitly allows it.
5. You must be at least this Ë¥ tall to contribute to this repository.

### How to submit
1. Download your custom card set from [Bloob.io](https://bloob.io/rottenapples) by going to "Custom Card Sets" and hitting the download button on the set you wish to share.
2. Rename the file to the following format: `[TAG] Pack Name.json`. A tag may only be one word and should be all uppercase. It should give the user an idea of what they may expect. Can't think of one? Use `[MISC]`.
3. Make sure you are logged into Github.
    * If you are unfamiliar with Github and Git, follow these steps.
        1. Click on a folder with the language (e.g. Use "en-GB" for English for example) your custom card set is in.
            * Is your language not yet available? Please make [an issue here requesting a folder](https://github.com/Venlious/bloob.io-rottenapples/issues/new) for your language to be added.
        2. While in the folder you should be able to see a button saying "Add file". You will get the option to "Create file", which you should click.
        3. In the section "Name your file..." fill in the name for the file you used earlier in step 2.
        4. Open the file using Notepad or a similar text editing program and copy all the contents and paste it inside the "Edit new file" section.
        5. Scroll down to the bottom and hit the button "Propose new file". Don't worry about the name or the description, I'll forgive you.
        6. Hit the button "Create pull request". You will now see a confirmation screen, simply press "Create pull request" again.
        7. It will now be reviewed and if approved it will become available for anyone to use.
    * If you know what you're doing, follow these steps.
        1. Make a pull request where you want the card set to be. Would you like me to hold your hand?
